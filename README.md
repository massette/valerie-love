# Valerie
**Valerie** is a tool to easily transition between values and do weird function stuff. It might be useless; I can't tell.

## What it Does
Started this because smooth transitions have always gummed up my code and I wanted a simple way to pass percentages of non-constant values to stuff. It's mainly for use in a GUI thing that I'm working on, but its written entirely in lua, so I guess you could use it for something else if you really wanted to.There's [a version without the weird props stuff](https://github.com/massette/valerie-love/blob/master/valerie-no-props.lua) if you just want the transitions part of it.
