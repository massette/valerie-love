# Valerie
**Valerie** is a tool to easily transition between values and do weird function stuff. It might be useless; I can't tell.

## What it Does
Started this because smooth transitions have always gummed up my code and I wanted a simple way to pass percentages of non-constant values to stuff. It's mainly for use in a GUI thing that I'm working on for LÃ¶ve2D, but its written entirely in lua, and the `panel_props` argument doesn't break anything if you just ignore it.
